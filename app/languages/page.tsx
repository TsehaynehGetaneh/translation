          Throughout our journey, HD Translation and Localization have consistently delivered professional translations in over 50 languages, African and Ethiopian languages. Our commitment extends beyond the mainstream, as we've expanded our language combinations to include rare languages and dialects across Asia and Africa. As our network of skilled translators has grown, so has our capacity to accommodate diverse languages and dialects. From African Amharic to Latin American Quechua, we possess the resources needed to fulfill your project requirements. For instance, if you have content in Hausa and need it translated into Swahili, we will assign one of our natives of Swahili fluent in Hausa. The extensive combinations of languages and subject matter expertise are broad in our pool. We have successfully provided translations from Amharic to Afar, Oromo to Arabic, and Spanish to Amharic at the highest level of quality and customer service and yet at an affordable price.
